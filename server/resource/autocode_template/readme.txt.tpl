After decompressing the code, paste the content of fe's api file into the front-end api folder and change it to the name you want.

After decompressing the back-end code, use the same method, put it in the path corresponding to the mvc you want, and register the automatically generated route in initRouter, and register the automatically generated model in registerTable.
